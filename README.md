# OSCP_Resources

This repository contains the nmap script, buffer overflow scripts and CherryTree template that I used during my 
OSCP exam.


## Nmap script usage:

1. Append the contents of nmap_script/script.txt into your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file. 
2. Source the file:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
OR
```
source ~/.zshrc
```

3. Syntax: 
```
prepare-oscp-recon-directory [BOX_NAME] [IP]
```

**Note:** You can change the root directory as per your preference, I have used my shared directory as an example.


## BOF scripts

The steps and explanation for Buffer overflow scripts are mentioned in the CherryTree template.
